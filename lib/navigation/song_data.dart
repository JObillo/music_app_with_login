    title: 'Thank You For Loving Me',
    artist: 'Bon Jovi',
    imageUrl: 'thankyou.png',
    audioUrl: 'thankyou.mp3',
    lyrics: '''
It's hard for me to say the things I wanna say sometimes
There's no-one here but you and me and that broken old street light
Lock the doors, we'll leave the world outside
All I've got to give to you are these five words when I

Thank you for loving me
For being my eyes when I couldn't see
For parting my lips when I couldn't breathe
Thank you for loving me
Thank you for loving me

I never knew I had a dream until that dream was you
When I look into your eyes the sky's a different blue
Cross my heart I wear no disguise
If I tried, you'd make believe that you believed my lies

Thank you for loving me
For being my eyes when I couldn't see
For parting my lips when I couldn't breathe
Thank you for loving me
Thank you for loving me

You pick me up when I fall down
You ring the bell before they count me out
If I was drowning you would part the sea
And risk your own life to rescue me

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeaheah!

Lock the doors, we'll leave the world outside
All I've got to give to you are these five words when I

Thank you for loving me
For being my eyes when I couldn't see
For parting my lips when I couldn't breathe

Thank you for loving me
When I couldn't fly, oh, you gave me wings
You parted my lips when I couldn't breathe

Thank you for loving me
Thank you for loving me
Thank you for loving me
Oh, for loving me

    title: 'When I Met you',
    artist: 'APO Hiking Society',
    imageUrl: 'when.png',
    audioUrl: 'when.mp3',
    lyrics: '''
There I was, an empty piece of a shell
Just minding my own world
Without even knowing what love and life were all about

Then you came
You brought me out of the shell
You gave the world to me
And before I knew
There I was, so in love with you

You gave me a reason for my being
And I love what I'm feeling
You gave me a meaning to my life
Yes, I've gone beyond existing
And it all began when I met you

I love the touch of your hair
And when I look in your eyes
I just know, I know I'm onto something good

And I'm sure, my love for you will endure
Your love will light up my world
And take all my cares away where they can't bother me

You gave me a reason for my being
And I love what I'm feeling
You gave me a meaning to my life
Yes, I've gone beyond existing
And it all began when I met you

You taught me how to love
You showed me a tomorrow and today
My love, that's different from the yesterday I knew
You taught me how to love
And darling, I will always cherish you
Today, tomorrow, and forever

And I'm sure when evening comes around
I know, we'll be making love like never before
My love, who could ask for more?

You gave me a reason for my being
And I love what I'm feeling

You gave me a meaning to my life
Yes, I've gone beyond existing
And it all began when I met you
When I met you

You gave me a reason (for my being)
And I love what I'm feeling (love what I'm feeling)
You gave me a meaning to my life
Yes, I've gone beyond existing
And it all began when I met you

When I met you

    audioUrl: 'loveme.mp3',
    lyrics: '''
Love me with all of your heart
That's all I want, love
Love me with all of your heart or not at all

Just promise me this
That you'll give me all your kisses
Every winter, every summer, every fall

When we are far apart or when you're near me
Love me with all of your heart as I love you
Don't give me your love
For a moment, or an hour
Love me always as you've loved me from the start
With every beat of your heart

Just promise me this
That you'll give me all your kisses
Every winter, every summer, every fall

When we are far apart or when you're near me
Love me with all of your heart as I love you
Don't give me your love
For a moment or an hour
Love me always as you've loved me from the start
With every beat of your heart

    title: 'Come What May',
    artist: 'Air Supply',

    audioUrl: 'come.mp3',
    lyrics: '''
When she looks at me
I know the girl sees things nobody else can see
All of the secret fears inside and all the craziness I hide
She looks into my soul and reads me like nobody can

And she doesn't judge the man
She just takes me as I am

Come what may, she believes
And that faith is something I've never known before
Come what may, she loves me
And that love has helped me open a door
Making me love myself a little more

When I turn away
She knows those are the times, there's nothing she can say
Nothing that anyone can do, and so she lets me live it through
And when I'm in my darkest hour of uncertainty

She just simply lets me be
And goes right on loving me

Come what may, she believes
And that faith is something I've never known before
Come what may, she loves me
And that love has helped me open a door
Making me love myself a little more
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

And when it seems my dreams have all slipped through my fingers
When they just can't be found, I turn around
And there they are shining in her eyes (shining in her eyes)
Come what may, she believes

And that faith is something I've never known before
Come what may, she loves me
And that love has helped me open a door
Making me love myself a little more

Come what may, she believes
And that faith is something I've never known before
Come what may, she loves me
And that love has helped me open a door

    title: 'Maybe This Time',

    audioUrl: 'maybe.mp3',
    lyrics: '''
Two old friends meet again
Wearing older faces
Talk about the places they've been
Two old sweethearts who fell apart
Somewhere long ago
How are they to know
Someday they'd meet again
And have a need for more than reminiscing

Maybe this time
It'll be loving they'll find
Maybe now they can be more than just friends
She's back in his life
And it feels so right
Maybe this time, love won't end

It's the same old feeling back again
It's the one that they had way back when
They were too young to know when love is real

But somehow, some things never change
And even time hasn't cooled the flame
It's burning even brighter than it did before
It got another chance and if they take it

Maybe this time
It'll be loving they'll find
Maybe now they can be more than just friends (just friends)
She's back in his life
And it feels so right
Maybe this time, love won't end

She's smiling like she used to smile way back then
She's feeling like she used to feel way back when
They tried, but something kept them
Waiting for this magic moment, oh-woah

Maybe this time
It'll be loving they'll find
Maybe now they can be more than just friends, oh
She's back in his life and it feels so right
Maybe this time (this time)
Maybe this time (this time)
Maybe this time
Love won't end

    lyrics: '''
Come stop your crying
It will be alright
Just take my hand
Hold it tight
I will protect you
From all around you
I will be here
Don't you cry

For one so small
You seem so strong
My arms will hold you
Keep you safe and warm
This bond between us
Can't be broken
I will be here don't you cry

I will be here don't you cry
'Cause you'll be in my heart
Yes, you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forever more

You'll be in my heart
No matter what they say
You'll be here in my heart
Always

Always

    lyrics: '''
Please come now, I think I'm falling
I'm holding on to all I think is safe
It seems I found the road to nowhere
And I'm trying to escape

I yelled back when I heard thunder
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it, let me say
Let me say

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
Maybe six feet ain't so far down

I'm looking down, now that it's over
Reflecting on all of my mistakes
I thought I found the road to somewhere
Somewhere in His grace

I cried out, "Heaven, save me"
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it, let me say
Let me say

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
Maybe six feet ain't so far down

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
Maybe six feet ain't so far down

I'm so far down

Sad eyes follow me
But I still believe there's something left for me
So, please come stay with me
'Cause I still believe there's something left for you and me
For you and me
For you and me
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
Maybe six feet ain't so far down

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
Maybe six feet ain't so far down

Please come now, I think I'm falling
I'm holding on to all I think is safe
